abstract = {Bromelia antiacantha flowered from December to February and during this period the central leaves and bracts displayed a bright red colour. The inflorescence bears 150-350 flowers, with 10-35 flowers opening per day over 4-5 days. The flowers are dark magenta coloured with white margins, tubular-shaped with a wide opening, and their stigma is situated below the anthers. Anthesis began around 4:00 h and flowers lasted approximately 15 h. The highest nectar volume and sugar concentration occurred between 4:00-6:00 h; after this period, both decreased throughout the day. B. antiacantha is partially self-incompatible, non-autogamous, and therefore, pollinator dependent. The hummingbirds Thalurania glaucopis, Amazilia fimbriata, and Ramphodon naevius were its most frequent pollinators (55{\%} of the visits), visiting flowers mainly in the afternoon. The scattered distribution of B. antiacantha promoted trap-lining behaviour of the hummingbirds, which favoured fruit set through xenogamy. Corolla colour, wide flower opening, sweet odour and concentrated nectar early in the day favoured bee visitation. Of the 38{\%} of bee visits, 96{\%} were made by Bombus morio, mainly in the morning and their behaviour promoted self-pollination. The bee Trigona spinipes frequently acted as a pollen and nectar thief early in the morning, excluding most of the hummingbirds. Bromelia antiacantha has ornithophilous and melittophilous features, and despite being pollinated by two kinds of agents, its reproductive success depends on a given set of circumstances. {\textcopyright} Georg Thieme Verlag KG.},

abstract = {A field survey of flowering plants used as food resource by the adults of Heliconius erato phyllis (Fabricius, 1775) was carried out in four sites located in Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil. Samples were taken in preserved areas of the Atlantic Rain and Myrtaceae forests, an Eucalyptus plantation, and an urban park. Adult feeding frequencies on flowers were registered monthly from December 1996 to May 1997, on plants located on previously marked 200 m long transects. Flowers on which H. erato phyllis fed in the field were collected, drawn and morphometrically characterized. Feeding was registered on flowers of twenty-three species, of which seventeen are new records for H. erato in Brazil. The use of a given plant varied among localities, as a function of its corresponding abundance. The most visited flowers were those of Lantana camara L. and Stachytarpheta cayennensis (Rich.) Vahl, followed by Dahlia pinnata Voss in the urban site. The data suggest the existence of size and shape convergence between the proboscis and the small, tubular flowers upon which H. erato phyllis feeds. They also indicate that H. erato phyllis adults have an opportunistic nectar feeding / pollen gathering habit, using several of those flowers available in a given time and locality that fit such a morphometrical pattern. Since plant species of both primitive and derived families are used, there is no indication that phylogenetic constraints play a major role in this association, nor that color of flowers, growth pattern or size of the plants are relevant in determining their use by H. erato phyllis.},

The most frequent visitors were a small species of stingless bee (Meliponinae) and a skipper (Hesperiidae). Approximately three-quarters of all floral visitors visited only one flower during a stay. Most visitors were observed at noon and in direct sunlight, and there was a positive correlation between the number of J. rusbyi flowers displayed and the number of visitors.

abstract = {In Brazil, studies focusing on reproductive biology and aspects of pollination in the genus Ruellia have demonstrated common characteristics such as pollination by hummingbird, the predominance of self-fertility and spontaneous self-pollination. The objectives of this study were to describe the floral biology, nectar production, the reproductive system, the effect of pollination intensity and flowering phenology of Ruellia angustiflora, as well as keeping a record of the hummingbirds that visit the flowers of this species. Data collection was performed in a stretch of the Salobrinha stream in the Serra da Bodoquena, Mato Grosso do Sul, from August 2005 to July 2006. R. angustiflora flowered throughout most of the study period; it has diurnal anthesis and has increased nectar production in the morning hours with decreasing production rates during the day. The results of the reproduction experiments indicate self-fertility and pollen limitation in R. angustiflora. Among experiments with different pollination intensity there was no significant difference in fruit formation. Four hummingbird species were observed visiting the flowers of R. angustiflora, and Phaethornis pretrei was the most frequent followed by females of Thalurania furcata. According to its behavior and frequency of visits, P. pretrei can be considered the main pollinator of R. angustiflora in the study area. The experiments on flowers treated with different pollen loads indicate that most successful fruit formation in this species is obtained in flowers that received greater pollen loads on their stigmas. Besides, data suggest that major success in fruit set could be reached with more than three visits of P. pretrei. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The objective was to identify the reproductive phenology and the pollination and dispersal syndromes of understory species of Semi-deciduous Dry Forest. The work was carried out from May 2010 to May 2011 in a forest fragment, about 29 hectares, localized in Catal{\~{a}}o city, Goi{\'{a}}s State, Brazil. The phenological phases were observed weekly along a transect at 1000m. Pollination and dispersion syndromes were determined through literature data, and theses data were linked to phenology. The flowering proportion reached the peak (43,13{\%}) in December 2010 (rainy) and fruiting (30{\%}) in September 2010 (dry). Acanthaceae flowering peak in May 2010 and February 2011; Piperaceae peaked in October 2010 and Rubiaceae in December 2010. Fruiting in the Acanthaceae occurred during the dry period and the beginning of the rainy season, with the highest incidence in October 2010, Piperaceae reached their peak in May 2011, while in the Rubiaceae, it went on for 11 months, with the highest incidence being in March 2011. Two Acanthaceae and one Piperaceae species not fruited, but all species presented flowering. Pollination syndromes found were Ornithophily, peaking in May 2010, Melittophily, in October 2010, and Psycophily, in January 2011. Dispersal syndromes found were Anemochoric, with a higher incidence in October 2010, and Ornithocoric with two peaks, one in July 2010 and other in May 2011. The year-long presence of flowering and/or fruiting species contributes to the survival and dynamics of the community studied, because these species play an important role maintaining bees and birds in the fragment, which are important vectors of pollination and dispersal, respectively. Considering the rapid loss of the Cerrado vegetation in recent times and the study site to be a fragment localized inside the urban environment, the conservation of the green area becomes important, regardless of its small size, due to the important ecological processes that lie therein, as portrayed in this study.},

The aim of this work was to analyze the flowering phenology and the breeding system of three co-occurring species of Ruellia: R. brevifolia (Pohl) C. Ezcurra and R. menthoides (Nees) Hiern, both cleistogamous, and R. subsessilis (Nees) Lindau. Seed germination was tested and the occurrence of vegetative propagation verified. Ruellia subsessilis flowered throughout the year, with a peak in October. Ruellia brevifolia produced flowers mainly from February to July, with a flowering peak in March. Ruellia menthoides produced flowers from August to December with a flowering peak in September. All species are self-compatible; Ruellia brevifolia and R. menthoides are facultative autogamous species and R. subsessilis is a facultative xenogamous species. High percentages of normal seedlings (from 67{\%} up to 83{\%}) were obtained from seeds produced through selfing. Besides sexual reproduction, the species showed vegetative propagation, i.e., branch fragments segregated from the motherplant, which develop adventitious roots. The species, therefore, showed sexual and asexual reproductive strategies. The former are distinct flowering peak, autogamous or allogamous flowers as well as ornitophilous or mellittophilous ones, and cleistogamous flowers. However, the result of sexual strategies was common to all of them, i.e., production of fruits with viable seeds during the entire year. The balance among the various reproductive mechanisms seems to confer to these species a high degree of adaptation in altered environments as shown in areas of their occurrence at the forest fragment studied.},

abstract = {Specialized plants like those in genus Geissomeria Lindl. (Acanthaceae) seem to depend directly on pollination by hummingbirds for reproduction. The goal of this study was to investigate the pollination biology of Geissomeria pubescens Nees (Acanthaceae) in a forest fragment in the municipality of Catal{\~{a}}o, state of Goi{\'{a}}s, Brazil, including aspects of morphology, floral biology, energy availability from nectar, and reproductive system. Geissomeria pubescens has pendulous red flowers, tubular corolla, diurnal anthesis, and no odor. These floral traits characterize G. pubescens as an ornithophilous species. The total amount of energy available from nectar was 8.60 ± 2.87 cal{\textperiodcentered}flower-1, and each individual produced up to 22.53 cal{\textperiodcentered}day-1. Based on the resources offered by G. pubescens, the fragment studied may support up to 94.6 hummingbirds during the peak of nectar availability. Hummingbirds were the only flower visitors, and Thalurania furcata (Gmelin, 1788) was the main pollinator. Flowers from manual cross- and self-pollination treatments produced fruits, but fruit set was low compared with open pollination. These results, along with the lack of fruit set from agamospermy and spontaneous selfing, demonstrate the importance of hummingbirds for pollen flow and, consequently, for fruit formation in G. pubescens.},

abstract = {Studies involving aspects of pollination and breeding system in Angiosperms are fundamental in understanding many ecological and evolutionary processes. Thus, a literature review was conducted to aim of compiling information on the pollination and reproductive system in species of Acanthaceae Juss. in Brazil. A total of 30 studies, count 31 species, were part of this review. Regarding geographical distribution of studies, the Southeast Brazil (50{\%}) and Atlantic Forest biome (56.7{\%}) had the higher proportion of studies. Four pollination syndromes were recorded: trochilophily, melittophily, psycophily, and chiropterophily, in which trochilophily was predominant (79.31{\%} of species). Consequently, hummingbirds were the most common flower visitors, interacting with 86.2{\%} of the species, and Phaethornis pretrei was the main hummingbird visitor. Other groups of visitors were also recorded, such as bees (second main group, 34.5{\%}), butterflies, bats, moths, wasps, flies and beetles. From the 17 species studied in Brazil about the reproductive system, all have androgynous flowers and 16 species (94.1{\%}) selfcompatibility. Intrinsic factors such as herkogamy and dichogamy were common in species of Acanthaceae, constituting mechanisms that minimize interference between male and female functions in androgynous flowers and maximize cross-pollination. Approximately 41.2{\%} of species presented spontaneous self-pollination, i.e. production of fruits without the need of pollinators. Reproductive strategies such as cleistogamy and agamospermy were also recorded in species of Acanthaceae in Brazil. However, more studies on the pollination and reproductive system with species of Acanthaceae in Brazil need to be developed to expand the sampling and then support better the estimates of this review.},

abstract = {It is clear that the majority of flowering plants are pollinated by insects and other animals, with a minority utilising abiotic pollen vectors, mainly wind. However there is no accurate published calculation of the proportion of the ca 352 000 species of angiosperms that interact with pollinators. Widely cited figures range from 67{\%} to 96{\%} but these have not been based on firm data. We estimated the number and proportion of flowering plants that are pollinated by animals using published and unpublished community-level surveys of plant pollination systems that recorded whether each species present was pollinated by animals or wind. The proportion of animal-pollinated species rises from a mean of 78{\%} in temperate-zone communities to 94{\%} in tropical communities. By correcting for the latitudinal diversity trend in flowering plants, we estimate the global number and proportion of animal pollinated angiosperms as 308 006, which is 87.5{\%} of the estimated species-level diversity of flowering plants. Given current concerns about the decline in pollinators and the possible resulting impacts on both natural communities and agricultural crops, such estimates are vital to both ecologists and policy makers. Further research is required to assess in detail the absolute dependency of these plants on their pollinators, and how this varies with latitude and community type, but there is no doubt that plant-pollinator interactions play a significant role in maintaining the functional integrity of most terrestrial ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {Many recent studies have suggested that the majority of animal-pollinated plants have a higher diversity of pollinators than that expected according to their pollination syndrome. This broad generalization, often based on pollination web data, has been challenged by the fact that some floral visitors recorded in pollination webs are ineffective pollinators. To contribute to this debate, and to obtain a contrast between visitors and pollinators, we studied insect and bird visitors to virgin flowers of Hypoestes aristata in the Bamenda Highlands, Cameroon. We observed the flowers and their visitors for 2-h periods and measured the seed production as a metric of reproductive success. We determined the effects of individual visitors using 2 statistical models, single-visit data that were gathered for more frequent visitor species, and frequency data. This approach enabled us to determine the positive as well as neutral or negative impact of visitors on H. aristata's reproductive success. We found that (i) this plant is not generalized but rather specialized; although we recorded 15 morphotaxa of visitors, only 3 large bee species seemed to be important pollinators; (ii) the carpenter bee Xylocopa cf. inconstans was both the most frequent and the most effective pollinator; (iii) the honey bee Apis mellifera acted as a nectar thief with apparent negative effects on the plant reproduction; and (iv) the close relationship between H. aristata and carpenter bees was in agreement with the large-bee pollination syndrome of this plant. Our results highlight the need for studies detecting the roles of individual visitors. We showed that such an approach is necessary to evaluate the pollination syndrome hypothesis and create relevant evolutionary and ecological hypotheses. {\textcopyright} 2013 Pady{\v{s}}{\'{a}}kov{\'{a}} et al.},

The purpose of this taxonomic treatment is to discuss, in alphabetical order, all the known Bolivian species of the family, and as such, this work is a ready reference for botanists, so that they may identify their collections of acanthaceous plants or use the keys for detecting further undescribed species. Except for brief discussions to indicate possible relationships of the novelties to allied species, no phylogenetic inferences within the family have been made. A full list of synonyms for the Bolivian species and those of adjoining countries has been prepared. Keys, species descriptions, and specimen distribution data is provided.

abstract = {The breeding systems, reproductive efficacies, and densities of selected trees, shrubs, vines, and hemiparasites of a second- ary decduous mid-elevation tropical forest in Venezuela are investigated. A total of 77.17 percent of the species studied are adapted for obligate outbreeding, 54.45 percent through the possession of genetic self-incompatibility, and 22.72 per- cent by way of dioecy or functional dioecy. Reproductive densities (density of flowering individuals) vary from 2.0 to 165.9 individuals per species per hectare with a mean of 10.7 and median of 5.0. Hemiparasites and vines form denser populations than do trees and shrubs. The densities of tree and shrub species are similar. All species, whether obligately outbred or genetically self-compatible, set abundant seed under the ecological conditions of the community. Distance be- tween the individuals of a population does not limit seed set under obligate outbreeding. The reproductive efficacies of dioecious species are higher than those of genetically incompatible hermaphrodites. Non-autogamous compatible herma- phrodites set a lower percentage of seed than do autogamous hermaphrodites. The proportion of outbreeding species in the secondary tropical forest is similar to that reported for a speciose tropical deciduous forest in Costa Rica; however, the species of the secondary forest exhibit higher reproductive efficacies. Factors favoring the maintenance of high proportions of obligately outbred species in species-rich tropical ecosystems are discussed. RECENT},

abstract = {Pollinators are a key component of global biodiversity, providing vital ecosystem services to crops and wild plants. There is clear evidence of recent declines in both wild and domesticated pollinators, and parallel declines in the plants that rely upon them. Here we describe the nature and extent of reported declines, and review the potential drivers of pollinator loss, including habitat loss and fragmentation, agrochemicals, pathogens, alien species, climate change and the interactions between them. Pollinator declines can result in loss of pollination services which have important negative ecological and economic impacts that could significantly affect the maintenance of wild plant diversity, wider ecosystem stability, crop production, food security and human welfare. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},
